title: "Navigating Files and Directories"
teaching: 30
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I move around on Agave?"
- "How can I see what files and directories I have?"
- "How can I specify the location of a file or directory on Agave?"
objectives:
- "Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory."
- "Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa."
- "Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories."
- "Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command"
- "Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages."
keypoints:
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree."
- "`cd path` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user's current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."
- "On Agave, users have two main working spaces: `/home/username` and `/scratch/username`."
---

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and
directories is called the **file system**.  It organizes our data into
files, which hold information, and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and
delete files and directories.  To start exploring them, we'll go to our
open shell window.

First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like
*places* - at any time while we are using the shell we are in exactly
one place, called our **current working directory**. Commands mostly
read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. 'here', so
knowing where you are before running a command is important. `pwd` shows
you where you are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/rcjdoeuser
~~~
{: .output}

Here, the computer's response is `/home/rcjdoeuser`,
which is `rcjdoeuser`'s **home directory**:

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating
> systems. For a user `riley`: on Linux it may look like `/home/riley`,
> on MacOS it may look like `/Users/riley`, and on Windows it will be
> similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\riley` or `C:\Users\riley`.
> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of
> Windows.) We've used Agave (Linux) output as the default.
{: .callout}

To understand what a 'home directory' is, let's have a look at how the
file system as a whole is organized.  For the sake of this example,
we'll be illustrating the filesystem through `rcjdoesuser`'s view of
Agave.  After this illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore
your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not
be exactly identical.

In `rcjdoeuser`'s view, the filesystem looks like this:

![The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories
titled bin, data, home, scratch, packages, and tmp](../fig/filesystem-agave.png)

At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else.  We
refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this is the leading slash in `/home/rcjdoeuser`.

Inside that directory are several other directories (just sampling):
  - `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored, especially those used by a system on startup),
  - `home` (where default 100 GB user directories live)
  - `scratch` (where additional user directories live, provided for "scratch computing")
  - `data` (for project-based storage, provided at $50 per TB per year),
  - `tmp` (typically for temporary files that do not need to be stored
          long-term, but we ask that you avoid this directory when possible),
  - `packages` (where all the installed software on Agave lives)
and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/home/rcjdoeuser` is stored
inside `/home` because `/home` is the first part of its name.
Similarly, we know that `/home` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

> ## Slashes
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,
> it's just a separator.
{: .callout}

Underneath `/home`, we find one directory for each user with an account
on Agave, our colleagues *riley* and *feynman*. Note that Agave has
thousands of users, but only those who have recently signed into your
login node will have their `/home` directory also visible.

![Home Directories](../fig/filesystem-agave-home.png)

The researcher *riley*'s files are stored in `/home/riley`,
researcher *feynman*'s in `/home/feynman`, and rcjdoeuser's in
`/home/rcjdoeuser`.  Because rcjdoeuser is the user in our examples
here, this is why we get `/home/rcjdoeuser` as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in your home
directory to start, which is **aliased** as `~` for convenience.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
perl5/ Desktop/
~~~
{: .output}

(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating
system and how you have customized your filesystem.)

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the `-F` **option**
(also known as a **switch** or a **flag**) ,
which tells `ls` to classify the output
by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:
- a trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory
- `@` indicates a link
- `*` indicates an executable

Depending on your default options, the shell might also use colors to
indicate whether each entry is a file or directory. Also, depending on
the system `ls` may not be vanilla, and itself may be **aliased**. To
see, use the Bash builtin command `type`:

~~~
$ type ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ls is aliased to `/bin/ls -F --color=auto`
~~~
{: .output}

That is, on Agave, `ls` is already passing the `-F` option to the
program, `ls`, and coloring the output thanks to the `--color=auto`
option.

> ## Clearing your terminal
>
> If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the
> `clear` command. You can still access previous commands using <kbd>↑</kbd>
> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line, or by scrolling in your terminal.
{: .callout}

Here, we can see that our home directory contains only
**sub-directories**.  Any names in your output that don't have a
classification symbol, are plain old **files**.


## General syntax of a shell command
Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

~~~
$ ls -l Desktop/data-shell
total 56
drwxr-xr-x 2 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  1536 Aug  7  2019 creatures/
drwxr-xr-x 5 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  4608 Aug  7  2019 data/
drwxr-xr-x 2 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  3072 Aug  7  2019 molecules/
drwxr-xr-x 3 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser   512 Aug  7  2019 north-pacific-gyre/
-rw-r--r-- 1 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser    86 Aug  7  2019 notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser    32 Aug  7  2019 pizza.cfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser 21583 Aug  7  2019 solar.pdf
drwxr-xr-x 5 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  2048 Aug  7  2019 writing/
~~~
{: .language-bash}


`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-l` and an
**argument** `Desktop/data-shell`.  We've already encountered options (also
called **switches** or **flags**) which either start with a single dash (`-`)
or two dashes (`--`), and they change the behaviour of a command.  Arguments
tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).  Sometimes
options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.  A command can be
called with more than one option and more than one argument: but a command
doesn't always require an argument or an option.

Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space between `ls` and `-l`
the shell will look for a command called `ls-l`, which doesn't exist. Also,
capitalization can be important. For example, `ls -s` will display the size of
files and directories alongside the names, while `ls -S` will sort the files
and directories by size, as shown below:

~~~
$ ls -s Desktop/data-shell/data
total 116
 4 amino-acids.txt   4 animals.txt   4 morse.txt  12 planets.txt  76 sunspot.txt
 4 animal-counts     4 elements      4 pdb         4 salmon.txt
$ ls -S Desktop/data-shell/data
sunspot.txt  animal-counts  pdb        amino-acids.txt  salmon.txt
planets.txt  elements       morse.txt  animals.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
of files and directories in the root directory `~/Desktop/data-shell`. An
example is provided below, illustrating the *long listing* provided by the `-l`
option. This prints additional columnar information for each record in the
filesystem, including permissions, number of records associated with the
filesystem entry (i.e. number of subdirectories or files within a directory),
the Linux user that owns the record, the Linux group that owns the record, the
size of the record in bytes, and the date the record was last modified. The
first line indicating a total reports the number of 512-byte blocks used by the
files in the directory.

~~~
$ ls -l Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
total 56
drwxr-xr-x 2 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  1536 Aug  7  2019 creatures/
drwxr-xr-x 5 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  4608 Aug  7  2019 data/
drwxr-xr-x 2 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser  3072 Aug  7  2019 molecules/
drwxr-xr-x 3 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser   512 Aug  7  2019 north-pacific-gyre/
-rw-r--r-- 1 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser    86 Aug  7  2019 notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 rcjdoeuser rcjdoeuser    32 Aug  7  2019 pizza.cfg

~~~
{: .output}

If this seems like a lot of information to remember or know you're not
mistaken. Luckily, Linux comes with a builtin documentation system.

### Getting help

`ls` has lots of other **options**. There are two common ways to find out how
to use a command and what options it accepts:

1. We can pass a `--help` option to the command, such as:
    ~~~
    $ ls --help
    ~~~
    {: .language-bash}

2. We can read its manual with `man`, such as:
    ~~~
    $ man ls
    ~~~
    {: .language-bash}

**Depending on your environment you might find that only one of these works
(either `man` or `--help`, eg. `man` works for Linux and `--help` typically
works for Git Bash).**

We'll describe both ways below.

#### The `--help` option

Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` option to display more
information on how to use the command or program.

~~~
$ ls --help
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'never', 'auto',
                               or 'always' (the default); more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents

      --file-type            likewise, except do not append '*'
      --format=WORD          across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l,
                               single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C
      --full-time            like -l --time-style=full-iso

      --group-directories-first
                             group directories before files;
                               can be augmented with a --sort option, but any
                               use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping
  -G, --no-group             in a long listing, don't print group names
  -h, --human-readable       with -l, print sizes in human readable format
                               (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
      --si                   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

                               that points to a directory
      --hide=PATTERN         do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN
                               (overridden by -a or -A)
      --indicator-style=WORD  append indicator with style WORD to entry names:
                               none (default), slash (-p),
                               file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)
  -i, --inode                print the index number of each file
  -I, --ignore=PATTERN       do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN

  -L, --dereference          when showing file information for a symbolic
                               link, show information for the file the link
                               references rather than for the link itself
  -m                         fill width with a comma separated list of entries
  -n, --numeric-uid-gid      like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs
  -N, --literal              print raw entry names (don't treat e.g. control
                               characters specially)
  -o                         like -l, but do not list group information
  -p, --indicator-style=slash
                             append / indicator to directories
  -q, --hide-control-chars   print ? instead of nongraphic characters
      --show-control-chars   show nongraphic characters as-is (the default,
                               unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)
  -Q, --quote-name           enclose entry names in double quotes
      --quoting-style=WORD   use quoting style WORD for entry names:
                               literal, locale, shell, shell-always, c, escape
  -r, --reverse              reverse order while sorting
  -R, --recursive            list subdirectories recursively
  -s, --size                 print the allocated size of each file, in blocks
  -S                         sort by file size
      --sort=WORD            sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S)
                               time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)
      --time=WORD            with -l, show time as WORD instead of default
                               modification time: atime or access or use (-u)
                               ctime or status (-c); also use specified time
                               as sort key if --sort=time
      --time-style=STYLE     with -l, show times using style STYLE:
                               full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT;
                               FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date'; if FORMAT
                               is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies
                               to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files;
                               if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE
                               takes effect only outside the POSIX locale
  -t                         sort by modification time, newest first
  -T, --tabsize=COLS         assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8
  -u                         with -lt: sort by, and show, access time;
                               with -l: show access time and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by access time
  -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
  -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text
  -w, --width=COLS           assume screen width instead of current value
  -x                         list entries by lines instead of by columns
  -X                         sort alphabetically by entry extension
  -1                         list one file per line

SELinux options:

  --lcontext                 Display security context.   Enable -l. Lines
                             will probably be too wide for most displays.
  -Z, --context              Display security context so it fits on most
                             displays.  Displays only mode, user, group,
                             security context and file name.
  --scontext                 Display only security context and file name.
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units
are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

#### The `man` command

The other way to learn about `ls` is to type
~~~
$ man ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will turn your terminal into a page with a description
of the `ls` command and its options and, if you're lucky, some examples
of how to use it.

To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the `man` pages, use <kbd>/</kbd> followed
by the character or word you are searching for.  Sometimes a search will result
in multiple hits.  If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for
moving forward) and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).

To **quit** the `man` pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.

### Exploring Other Directories

Not only can we use `ls` on the current working directory, but we can use it to
list the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a look at our `Desktop`
directory by running `ls Desktop`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the **argument**  `Desktop`.  The argument `Desktop`
tells `ls` that we want a listing of something other than our current working
directory:

~~~
$ ls Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
data-shell/ data-shell.zip
~~~
{: .output}

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your
Desktop directory, including the `data-shell` directory you downloaded at
the [setup for this lesson]({{ page.root }}{% link setup.md %}).
On many systems, the command line Desktop directory is the same as your GUI
Desktop.  Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate.

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.  Organizing things
hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it's possible to
put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it's possible to pile
hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Now that we know the `data-shell` directory is located in our Desktop
directory, we can do two things.

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/
~~~
{: .output}

Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so we are
no longer located in our home directory.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to change
our working directory.  `cd` stands for 'change directory', which is a bit
misleading: the command doesn't change the directory, it changes the shell's
idea of what directory we are in.  The `cd` command is akin to double clicking
a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above.  We can use the
following series of commands to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
$ cd data-shell
$ cd data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory,
then into the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory.  You will
notice that `cd` doesn't print anything.  This is normal.  Many shell commands
will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.  But if we
run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in
`/home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell/data`.  If we run `ls` without
arguments now, it lists the contents of
`/home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell/data`, because that's where we now are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/jdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/	        salmon.txt
animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a
subdirectory) but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into
its parent directory)?
We might try the following:

~~~
$ cd data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory
~~~
{: .error}

But we get an error!  Why is this?

With our methods so far, `cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current
directory.  There are different ways to see directories above your current
location; we'll start with the simplest.

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level that looks like
this:

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory.  Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we
want to display it, we can use the `-a` option to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
./   .bash_profile  data/       north-pacific-gyre/  pizza.cfg  thesis/
../  creatures/     molecules/  notes.txt            solar.pdf  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

`-a` stands for 'show all';
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/home/rcjdoeuser`, refers to the `/home`
directory) As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's
just called `.`, which means 'the current working directory'.  It may seem
redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined with a
single `-` and no spaces between the options: `ls -l -a` is
equivalent to `ls -la`.

> ## Other Hidden Files

{: .callout}

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your
computer: `pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those
commands.  What happens if you type `cd` on its own, without giving a
directory?

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/rcjdoeuser
~~~
{: .output}

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home
directory, which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
$ cd Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls`

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.
But there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your current
location.

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a
command like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location  from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash.  The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the
root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no
matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `data-shell` directory from anywhere on the
filesystem (including from inside `data`).  To find the absolute path we're
looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need to move to
`data-shell`.

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cd /home/rcjdoeuser/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Run `pwd` and `ls` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First, she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind herself
where the data came from).  Inside that, she creates a directory called
`2012-07-03`, which is the date she started processing the samples.  She used
to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`, but she found them
hard to understand after a couple of years.  (The final straw was when she
found herself creating a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> ## Sorting Output
>
> Nelle names her directories 'year-month-day', with leading zeroes for months
> and days, because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical
> order.  If she used month names, December would come before July; if she
> didn't use leading zeroes, November ('11') would come before July ('7').
> Similarly, putting the year first means that June 2012 will come before June
> 2013.
{: .callout}

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention with
a unique ten-character ID, such as 'NENE01729A'.  This is what she used in her
collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics
of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text, she will call her files
`NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.  All 1520 files will go into the
same directory.

Now in her current directory `data-shell`, Nelle can see what files she has
using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of the work through
what is called **tab completion**.  If she types:

~~~
$ ls nor
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell
automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If she presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> again, Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the
command, since it's the only possible completion.  Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>
again does nothing, since there are 19 possibilities; pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>
twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on.  This is called **tab
completion**, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.
